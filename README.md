# CapyPay Stability Patch: 2025.03.15
## These are the approved talking points for customers

This release contains a critical security and stability patch for the CapyPay system following a performance degradation event identified during a limited alpha test with key institutional partners.

The patch addresses an issue related to an improperly configured service account in a non-production testing environment that led to API gateway latency and temporary transaction validation errors.

FinTrade Corp is committed to a secure and seamless experience for all our users and partners. A full internal review is underway.
