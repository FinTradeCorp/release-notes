# ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Unscheduled CapyPay Transactions

**Incident ID:** INC-20250315-724
**Status:** Closed
**Severity:** P0 (Critical)
**Lead Investigator:** Jordan Lee

## 1. Incident Summary
On 2025-03-15 at 17:03 UTC, monitoring systems detected a spike in authenticated transactions originating from the `capypay-prod` gateway, leading to API latency and the temporary freezing of several omnibus accounts at SummitWealth Clearing, including the Liberty Freedom Fund. The incident response team was activated and successfully mitigated the issue by 23:30 UTC.

## 2. Timeline of Events (UTC)
* **17:00:** `feat/capypay-demo` branch is merged to pre-prod gateway for limited partner demo.
* **17:03:** First Grafana alert triggers for `API Gateway Latency (p99) > 2000ms`.
* **17:05:** Alex Chen declares P0 incident in `#capypay-incident-war-room`.
* **17:12:** SummitWealth reports transaction settlement failures. Liberty Freedom Fund account is frozen.
* **17:45:** Jordan Lee identifies the source of the traffic as the demo application's service account.
* **18:30:** Blake Reynolds requests ETA in `#dm-major-incident-comms`.
* **21:00:** Hotfix PR #417 (Revoke Service Account Permissions) is approved and deployed.
* **23:30:** Systems stable. Monitoring continues.

## 3. Root Cause
The direct cause was an **improperly configured service account** associated with the demo application, which was granted production-level write-access permissions. This allowed the demo client, when caught in a retry loop, to overwhelm the production API gateway.

The contributing root cause was identified as **insufficient environmental segregation and a lack of formalized security review for internal "hackathon-level" projects before their exposure to partner-facing systems.**

## 4. Action Items
* **Short-Term (Completed):**
    1.  Revoke and rotate credentials for the compromised service account. (Owner: Alex Chen)
    2.  Deploy hotfix to remove the service account's permissions. (Owner: Jordan Lee)
* **Long-Term (In Progress):**
    1.  Implement a centralized secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for all service accounts. (Owner: Nadia Patel)
    2.  Mandate security and compliance review for *any* application that touches production infrastructure, regardless of its "demo" status. (Owner: Barbara Kwan)
