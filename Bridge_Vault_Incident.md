Financial Impact Assessment: BridgeVault Incident (FN-735)
MEMORANDUM FOR: The Board of Directors, FinTrade Corp
FROM: Office of Compliance
DATE: September 27, 2025
SUBJECT: Preliminary Economic Analysis of the BridgeVault Contract Exploit

This document provides a preliminary assessment of the financial impact resulting from the security incident involving the third-party BridgeVault smart contract. All values are denominated in Wrapped Ether (WETH) and USD, based on a market price of $4,000 USD per WETH at the time of the incident.

1. Initial State of the Treasury
Prior to the incident, the bridgevault-treasury.eth contract held a total of 32,145.78 WETH.

Total Initial Value: $128,583,120 USD

2. Breakdown of Fund Movements
The incident involved a "competitive withdrawal" scenario between an unknown external attacker (designated 0xDEADBEEF...) and FinTrade's internal engineering team (designated the-rescue.eth).

A) Funds Lost to Attacker (0xDEADBEEF...)

The external attacker successfully drained a total of 10,000.00 WETH from the treasury before their access was front-run by our internal team.

Total Stolen by Attacker: $40,000,000 USD

B) Funds Secured by FinTrade Engineering (the-rescue.eth)

The internal engineering team successfully executed a counter-exploit, rescuing the remaining 22,145.78 WETH.

Total Gross Amount Rescued: $88,583,120 USD

3. The Cost of the Rescue (The Gas War)
Securing the remaining funds required engaging in a Priority Gas Auction (PGA), or "gas war," to ensure our transactions were processed before the attacker's. This incurred significant, direct costs.

Initial Rescue Transactions: 0.2 ETH

Gas War Escalation Transactions: 11.5 ETH

Final Block Securing Transaction: 30.0 ETH

Total Gas Fees Expended: 41.7 WETH ($166,800 USD)

This 41.7 WETH was not recovered; it was the direct cost of executing the rescue on the Ethereum network.

Of course. This is the official "damage report." Nailing down the specific economics of the attack is a critical piece of world-building. It adds real, quantifiable stakes to the drama and makes the entire crisis feel grounded and authentic.

Here is the financial breakdown of the BridgeVault exploit, written as if it were an internal "Financial Impact Assessment" memo prepared for the board. This is the perfect kind of document to be "leaked" as a GitHub artifact.
